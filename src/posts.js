It has emerged as the go-to language for web development, data science application development, Machine learning and also applications related to Big Data. Its popularity stems from several reasons like Its relatively easy to learn Its syntax is largely readable and lacks complexities of other competing languages. So developers can focus on applying logic rather than spending endless hours. Its a very versatile language Most of the operating systems support python. All services based on API and libraries also support python development. It is also object-oriented.

      "The two biggest social platforms have created a buzz in the application development industry. React Native by Facebook and Flutter by Google are the latest two cross-platforms for mobile application development technologies. The popularity of these frameworks has taken over the much older framework in a very short span of time. However, both React Native and Flutter are very popular among the developers who wish to create native applications for Android and iOS without spending much time and effort. Therefore, we recommend to learn mobile application development courses online at EdYoda- Free technology learning platform.",

      "We have had an insight into Artificial Intelligence. Well, one of its subfields is machine learning and this introduction will help you get a fair idea of what a machine learning online course holds. To begin with, one must understand what machine learning is. Basically, it is a concept wherein a machine attempts to understand the structure of a data and fits that into models that people can understand and utilize. While traditional forms of computing were all about solving problems using set instructions and data, machine learning is all about computers utilizing data, training on it and using statistical data to output values. Thus, in this way, the process of decision-making is automated for computers based on sample input data. Now that we know what Machine Learning is all about, it’s time to delve in a little deeper.",

      "Cloud computing has been rapidly gaining pace in the world of information technology. It has been observed that over 90% of global enterprises are using cloud technology as part of their business. Every industry has its own technology dynamics designed to suit its infrastructure. To understand the future of cloud computing, one needs to understand the dynamics of cloud computing in various key industries. According to the reports by Dell companies that invest in Big Data, cloud, mobility and security enjoy up to 53% faster revenue growth than their competitors. As it is becoming more and more difficult to keep all the information, programs, and systems up and running on in-house computer servers, it has become necessary to store data on the cloud.",

      "Simply put, web scraping is one of the tools developers use to gather and analyze information from the Internet. Some websites and platforms offer application programming interfaces (APIs) which we can use to access information in a structured way, but others might not. While APIs are certainly becoming the standard way of interacting with today’s popular platforms, we don’t always have this luxury when interacting with most of the websites on the internet.",
